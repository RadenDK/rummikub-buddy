# Rummikub Score Tracker

This is a small hobby project I built for my mom to help her keep track of Rummikub games.

I used it as an opportunity to learn Laravel and experiment with features like social sign-on, even if it might seem a bit overkill for a personal project like this.

The app stores user emails and associates players and games with their profile. It's tailored to a very specific use case, but it was a fun way to learn and build something useful at the same time.

You can try it out here: [https://rummikubbuddy.rasmusjensen.tech/login](https://rummikubbuddy.rasmusjensen.tech/login)  
(If it's still running!)
